Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating the intrinsic value of a security by examining related economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors. Investors and analysts use fundamental analysis to make informed investment decisions, particularly in the stock market. The goal is to determine whether a security is overvalued or undervalued and to estimate its potential future performance. Here are key components of fundamental analysis:

1. **Financial Statements:**
   - **Income Statement:** Reveals a company's revenues, expenses, and profits over a specific period.
   - **Balance Sheet:** Provides a snapshot of a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a particular point in time.
   - **Cash Flow Statement:** Illustrates the cash inflows and outflows, helping assess a company's liquidity.

2. **Earnings per Share (EPS):**
   - `EPS = Net Income / Number of Outstanding Shares`
   - **Purpose:** EPS indicates the company's profitability on a per-share basis. It's a key metric for assessing earnings growth.

3. **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E):**
   - `P/E Ratio = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share`
   - **Purpose:** P/E ratio compares the current market price of a stock to its earnings, providing insight into how the market values the company's earnings.

4. **Dividend Yield:**
   - Dividend Yield = Dividends per Share / Market Price per Share`
   - **Purpose:** Dividend yield measures the return on investment from dividends. It's particularly relevant for income-focused investors.

5. **Book Value:**
   - `Book Value = (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) / Number of Outstanding Shares`
   - **Purpose:** Book value reflects the net asset value of a company per share, providing an indication of its intrinsic value.

6. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
   - `Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity`
   - **Purpose:** This ratio assesses a company's financial leverage, indicating the proportion of debt used to finance its operations.

7. **Free Cash Flow:**
   - `Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures`
   - **Purpose:** Free cash flow represents the cash generated by a company's operations that can be used for dividends, debt reduction, or investment.

8. **Growth Prospects:**
   - **Earnings Growth:** Assessing a company's historical and expected future earnings growth is crucial for understanding its potential.
   - **Industry Trends:** Evaluating the growth prospects of the industry in which the company operates is essential.
