Several financial metrics are commonly used to measure returns on investments and assess the performance of an investment portfolio. Here are some key tools and metrics for measuring returns:

1. **Return on Investment (ROI):**
   - **Formula:** `$\( \text{ROI} = \left( \frac{\text{Current Value} - \text{Cost of Investment}}{\text{Cost of Investment}} \right) \times 100 \)$`
   - **Purpose:** ROI provides a straightforward measure of the profitability of an investment, expressed as a percentage. It is widely used for assessing the success of a single investment or a portfolio.

2. **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR):**
   - **Formula:** \( \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{\text{Ending Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{\text{Number of Years}}} - 1 \)
   - **Purpose:** CAGR represents the geometric progression ratio that provides a smoothed annual rate of growth over a specified time period. It is often used to measure the average annual rate of return for investments.

3. **Total Return:**
   - **Formula:** \( \text{Total Return} = \left( \frac{\text{Current Value} + \text{Income Earned}}{\text{Initial Investment}} \right) - 1 \)
   - **Purpose:** Total return considers not only capital appreciation but also includes any income generated by the investment, such as dividends or interest.

4. **Dividend Yield:**
   - **Formula:** \( \text{Dividend Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}}{\text{Stock Price per Share}} \right) \times 100 \)
   - **Purpose:** Dividend yield measures the income generated by an investment in the form of dividends. It is particularly relevant for income-focused investments like dividend-paying stocks.

5. **Sharpe Ratio:**
   - **Formula:** \( \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{\text{Portfolio Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate}}{\text{Portfolio Standard Deviation}} \)
   - **Purpose:** The Sharpe Ratio assesses the risk-adjusted return of an investment or portfolio. It considers both the return earned and the volatility or risk associated with that return.

6. **Treynor Ratio:**
   - **Formula:** \( \text{Treynor Ratio} = \frac{\text{Portfolio Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate}}{\text{Beta of the Portfolio}} \)
   - **Purpose:** Similar to the Sharpe Ratio, the Treynor Ratio evaluates the risk-adjusted return but specifically considers systematic risk (beta).

7. **Time-Weighted Return:**
   - **Calculation:** Time-weighted return is a method for measuring the compound rate of growth in a portfolio, excluding the effects of external cash flows.
   - **Purpose:** It provides an unbiased measure of the compound rate of return, especially in the presence of contributions or withdrawals to the portfolio.

8. **Risk-Adjusted Return:**
   - **Various Metrics:** Besides Sharpe Ratio and Treynor Ratio, other metrics like Jensen's Alpha and Information Ratio are used to assess risk-adjusted performance.
   - **Purpose:** These metrics help investors evaluate how well an investment has performed after adjusting for risk, providing insights into the effectiveness of the investment strategy.

When evaluating investment returns, it's essential to consider the specific characteristics and objectives of the investment, as different metrics may be more suitable for different scenarios. Additionally, understanding the limitations of each metric is crucial for accurate interpretation.
